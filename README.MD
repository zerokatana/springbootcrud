This is a sample project for Public Soft. I'm implementing the "Supplier" Entity in the already existing project with the "Person" Entity.

• First of all you should have installed the following requirements:
  1.OpenJDK 1.8
  2.Maven 3.x
  3.Git 2.x
  4.MySQL 5.x
  5.Node.js 6.x

• Server Application:
  1.Create an empty database with name: springbootcrud
  2.Open the file: springbootcrud-webapp/src/main/resources/application.properties and
    modify the following properties, depending on your MySQL installation:
  3.spring.datasource.username=root
  4.spring.datasource.password=1234
  5.Run the Application.class
  
• Client Application:
  1.Be sure that you are in the springbootcrud-client folder and execute the following
command: npm install
  2.When the installation will be finished you can run the Client with: npm run dev
  3.Then you can visit http://localhost:9000
# springbootcrud
